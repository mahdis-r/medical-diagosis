Benifiting from one of Andrew Ng's courses, here is the workflow I follow for this (and almost all my) projects:

- Scopig: Define Project
- Data:
- Modeling
- Deployment

There are a number of projects in this repo mostly utalizing datasets available on kagale that has been used in many courses and papers as benchmark. You can find them via links provided in README of each project.
